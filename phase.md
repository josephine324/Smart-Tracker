## Challenges I faced:
- I had to repeat the same commands over and over again, especially when something failed or didnâ€™t go through properly. It felt like I was stuck in a loop sometimes.
- There was no easy way to track what I had already done. If I took a break and came back, I had to remember where I left off  and sometimes I just ran everything again to be sure.
- Mistakes were easy to make, like forgetting a flag or running a command in the wrong order. One small error could mean starting all over.
- Learning IaC was tricky at first, especially writing Terraform files and figuring out how everything connects. But once I understood the basics, it was a game changer.
IaC helped me avoid repeating myself. I could define everything once in code, and re-run deployments without having to type all those commands again. It saved me time and effort.
